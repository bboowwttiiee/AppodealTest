# AppodealTest
Test task for Appodeal

This is a single-screen app. In the center of the screen there are four buttons, when you click on each of which a certain type of advertising is launched: banner, interstitial, rewarded video, and native.

There are also several features here. For example, the buttons can only be tapped when a specific type of ad is loaded and ready to be displayed. Also, if a banner is currently displayed, then when any of the other three types of ads are called, the banner will be hidden. Among other things you cannot call interstitial ad more than once a minute, because the button is disabled for 60 seconds once you tapped it. And when you open a list with naive ad, there will be no more than three ad blocks in this list.

You can see a demonstration of how it works in the video below:

By the way, the app supports portrait orientation.
